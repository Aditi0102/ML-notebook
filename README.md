# AI Surveillance

## üî≠ Overview
Surveillance is an integral part of security and control. The job requires extended periods of looking into multiple videos footages for an undesirable incident or evidence following the incident, which proves to be highly inefficient considering the massive amount of footages. This manual task provides evidence in court but is rarely used to prevent crime or react to it in real-time.
<br>
This projects aims to develop a real-time crime detection technology that can be integrated with any security system, to ensure public safety through visual crowd surveillance.

### üíº Work Completed
- [x] Model Trained over 800 videos and images to classify between violent and non-violent scenes
- [x] Computer Vision Script added for pedestrian detection.
- [x] Initial protoype still gives decent accuracy.
- [x] Room for Single Device Communication is up and working.

### ‚öôÔ∏è ToDo
- [ ] Extending the model to detect Suspicios and Non-Suspicious activities.
- [ ] Optimizing the model accuracy for better results.
- [ ] Using localised regions for predictive analysis.
